# Hi, I'm Dorian 👋

I work across Python, data, and systems—building small, practical projects that turn complex ideas into clear, runnable examples. Most of what I create supports my long-form writing at **https://plexdata.online**, where I explore money, analytics, visualisation, and the practical side of system design.

## 🔍 What I’m currently building

### **PLEX**
A long-term project focused on understanding money, systems, and data through clear examples, structured analysis, and reproducible Python code.

### **Code Walkthroughs**
Small, self-contained projects designed to pair directly with PLEX articles. Each one is built for readers who want to clone a repo and follow the logic step by step.

### **Data & Visualisation Workflows**
Lightweight datasets, cleaned CSVs, and chart scripts that form the backbone of many PLEX articles.
